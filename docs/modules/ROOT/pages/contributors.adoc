Recomma follows a docs-as-code workflow. Keep these guidelines in mind when preparing changes.

== Documentation Workflow

* Add or update pages under `docs/modules/ROOT/pages/`.
* Refresh the navigation (`docs/modules/ROOT/nav.adoc`) when new pages should appear in the rendered sidebar.
* Prefer concise sections with anchored headings so other teams can deep-link into specific guidance.
* Always mention when generated artefacts (`internal/api/ops.gen.go`, `storage/sqlcgen`) require regeneration.

== Converting Docs to README

The repository README will eventually be rendered from these sources. Until Antora publishing is automated:

. Maintain the canonical overview inside `docs/modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc` and related pages.
. When preparing a release, export a Markdown version for GitHub using Asciidoctor or Antora's site output. A quick local option is:
+
[source,bash]
----
asciidoctor -b docbook5 -a leveloffset=+1 docs/modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc -o README.html
pandoc README.html -f docbook -t gfm -o README.md
----
. Review the generated README to ensure anchors and callouts render as expected in GitHub.

We will replace the manual conversion with an Antora + GitHub Actions workflow that publishes HTML docs and refreshes `README.md` automatically.

== Coding Standards

* Target Go 1.25; run `go fmt` and `go test ./...` before submitting patches.
* Do not ignore errors—return them or handle explicitly.
* Generated files stay checked into version control.

== Commit Messages

Follow Conventional Commits, e.g. `docs: add setup guide`. Keep the subject in the imperative mood and explain context in the body when necessary.
